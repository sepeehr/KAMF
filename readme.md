# Krylov Approximation of Matrix Functions

This repository contains the codes and the report of semester project entitled "_On Krylov subspace methods for evaluating phi-functions appearing in exponential integrators_". The project has been done as a part of a Master's program in Computational Science and Engineering at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and has been hosted by the Chair of Numerical Algorithms and High-Performance Computing (ANCHP) in the Mathematics Department, supervised by Professor Daniel Kressner.

Please refer to `report.pdf` for a comprehensive description of the project and the methods. The notebooks `phifuncs.ipynb` and `trigfuncs.ipynb` contain the numerical experiments and can be used for regenerating the plots in the report.
